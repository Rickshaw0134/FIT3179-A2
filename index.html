    <h1 class="centered-heading">Malaysia's Population: Trends, Diversity & Growth</h1>
    <p class="centered-paragraph">Malaysia, located in Southeast Asia, has experienced significant population growth recently. 
        Currently, the country’s population is around 33 million, as of 2023. 
        This growth has been driven by increasing urbanization, improved healthcare, and rising economic development. 
        Although the population growth rate is slowing, it is still projected to continue in the coming years. 
        By 2030, Malaysia’s population could reach nearly 37 million people, driven by both natural increase and migration. 
        However, the country also faces challenges, especially as its workforce ages rapidly over time. 
        Therefore, sustaining economic growth and managing resources will be essential to support this growing population.</p>

    <p class="centered-paragraph">Malaysia's population is a rich blend of ethnic and cultural diversity. 
        The age pyramid clearly illustrates a balanced distribution of males and females across various age groups, which highlights a growing and dynamic society. 
        Additionally, it reflects an aging population, which will eventually impact the future workforce. 
        Moreover, the pie chart further emphasizes this diversity, with the Bumi Malay representing the largest group. 
        Meanwhile, significant Chinese, Indian, and other ethnic communities contribute to Malaysia's multi-ethnic composition. 
        Together, these groups shape the country's unique cultural and social fabric, ultimately strengthening its unity and economic development.</p>
